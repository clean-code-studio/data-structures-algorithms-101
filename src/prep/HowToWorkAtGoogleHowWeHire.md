## Overview
- 1. Common Google Myths (Myth Busting)
- 2. Talk About How Google Hires


### Myth Busting
- Myth: Only hire Ivy league backgruond
- Busted: Google wants diverse backgrounds - GPA is only taken into account if you've graduated recently

- Myth: Crazy brain teasers (How many golf balls would fit in the Empire State Building)
- Busted: Googler's would rather spend the time getting to know you

### Step 1: Googler Phone Interview
- From there you may have another phone interview with another relevant googler for that team
- Then comes the onsight interviews, technical gigs will have coding challenges with breaks between sessions- Following onsight interviews, your packet goes to the hiring committee
  - Your packet is nothing more than your interview your resume, any work examples you've submitted on it
  - The hiring committee signs off on it, then it goes to a senior level googler
  - If the senior googler signs off on it, then comes the call from Google with an offer to join the team
