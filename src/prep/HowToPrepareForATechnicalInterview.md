[How to: Prepare for a Google Engineering Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko-KkSmp-Lk)
--

### Tips
- Make sure you're ready to prove what's on your resume
- Data structures & algorithms
  - Hash Tables
  - Stacks
  - Arrays
  - Space & Time Complexity
  - Be prepared to code on a white board (different than on a computer)
  - Make sure you're brushed up on system design and object oriented design
- In general, you want to show your problem solving skills to the question you are asked
  - Coding question? Efficient code in short time
  - Design question? Work with your interviewer to create a higher level system
  - General analysis question? Show you understand all aspects of the problem
  - In the end, an interviewer wants to know they'd be comfortable working with you
- Specifically you should focus your preparation on the following areas
  - You'll spend the majority of your time writing code in your interviews
    - Be familiar with at least one coding language
    - Expected to know 
    	- Apis
    	- Object Oriented Design
    	- How to test your code 
    	- And how to come up with corner cases and edge cases for yours and other peoples code 
  - Another big thing is Algorithms (It's important)
    - You want to know how complex your algorithm is
      - Time and space complexity
      - If you give an O(n) algorithm and then say it's better than that's a bit awk
    - If you have a chance to study up on Other Algorithms like Dijkstra's and A-star
      - It'll probably help you too
  - Canidates with 3 or more years of industry experience should have hands on testing experience
    - How would you unit test the code you write?
    - What interesting inputs or test cases can you think of?
    - May be asked to design end-to-end integration, load and performance, or even security tests for real world systems such as g-mail for example  
  - Data Structures
    - Should study up on as many data structures and algorithms as humanly possible
    - You should know some of the most famous classes of np-complete problems
      - Traveling sales man
      - Knap sack
      - should be able to recognize these famous questions when asked in slightly different ways
    - Also try to figure out what np-complete actually means 
    - Trees
    - Some basic trees construction 
    - Traversal and manipulation algorithms
    - Hash tables
    - Stacks
    - Arrays
    - etc...
  - Math
    - Will be very relevant
    - Counting problems, basic probability
    - Should be familiar with n-choose k problems
  - Recursion
    - Practice problems that can be solved iteratively, but are more eloquently solved recursively
  - Operating Systems
    - Processes
    - Threads
    - Concurrency Issues
    - Semaphores
    - Mutexes
    - Locks
    - Resource Allocation
      - What resource a process or thread might need
    - Context switching
      - Brush up on that, understand it's initiated in the operating system and underlining hardware
    - Understand a bit about how scheduling works
  - System Design
    - Canidates who have been in the industry more than 5 years should have experience with system design
    - These questions are used to combine your knowledge, theory, and judgement to solve real world problems
      - Sample Topics:
        - Features sets
        - Interfaces
        - Class hierarchies
        - Distributed systems
        - Designing system under certain constraints
      - Have a familiarity with how the internet works
        - DNS 
        - Fire wall
  - Talk through your thought process
    - Better to talk through your thought process than to stay silent
  - Ask questions to clarify the challenge
    - Google interview questions are intentionally vague
    - Google wants you to keep thinking
    - Think about your current solution and how you could improve it
  - Practice
    - Find problems
    - Write code
    - Solve problems
